Sizmic Sporco lives a fairly quiet life, but that's just how she likes it. Though she may appear standoffish at first glance (which she doesn't really like but also hasn't really made a effort to change), she is friendly in general and doesn't like starting shit with someone for no reason. Sizmic tends to avoid groups of people she doesn't know, but is more open and comfortable around a group of friends. Sizmic's crop garden is locally well known and is her shining accomplishment in her eyes which she is very proud of. Sizmic's crops are whatever's in season, besides pumpkins, because those kept mysteriously disappearing overnight. When she isn't tending to her garden or doing stuff with friends, she generally games on her handheld system or is lurking internet threads, jumping in when she can offer some help or can add something meaningful.   Due to dealing with dirt on a daily basis, Sizmic doesn't mind if she needs to get a bit messy to accomplish something. Her lusus is a fairly large mole. (edited)
