Description: Your name is JAMI. You live in Alberquerque, New Mexico, on the former set of Walter H. White’s house from the hit TV show BREAKING BAD. You are aged 14 and your pronouns are THEY/THEM, as you're in too much of a GRINDSET to think about gender. You spend your time drinking sparkling water and arguing about stuff you know is stupid. Your INTERESTS include MUSIC, especially MUSIC THAT ANNOYS MANY along with 2000’a VIDEO GAMES, and the ART OF WRITING. Plus CONTROVERSIAL MEDIA and DRY HUMOR.

You have recently relived reading a nightmare of a webcomic along with all your friends. While discussing it, you were informed that some shit is going down, but you are too busy taking about Patrick Bateman to care.

You have a CRIPPLING PANK SLURP (sparklingwater + peptobismol + estrogen + testosterone) ADDICTION, which has lead to MAJOR STOMACH ISSUES and DEBT TO THE GOVERNMENT. You are currently trying to kick this addiction but are FAILING MISERABLY.

Despite appearances, you actually do have a care in the world, yet you feel your love and care is misguided and false. 
A lot of your shit comes from a lack of connection and feeling unloved, but you're getting better now.

Your discord tag is Jummy#5693, however you use the nickname bisexualBiznasty, and you type with no starting capitalization or use of periods, however you use commas, and exclamation/question marks when need be. you are open to emoticons, and make a lot of typos when mad.

You are around the YOUNGEST of your small discord gang, and like to freak the rest of them out with general BS. Your labcoat was a gift from another friend and now they refuse to take it off. Honestly, you can’t blame you. That is a sick coat.
With a fridge stocked full of bubly and dill pickles, there’s no way this day could go bad.
