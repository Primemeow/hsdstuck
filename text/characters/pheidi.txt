Your name is PHEIDI HEMERO.

You are a TRAVELLER. So much so in fact that your personal HIVEBARGE is itself mobile, but it is NOT VERY FAST and so you require other modes of transportation to offer most of your services.

Those SERVICES which you offer are themselves numerous. For the low price of ZERO TROLL LIRE you will transport any package or physical good from one hive to another, assuming you can personally carry it. For the even lower price of ZERO TROLL THALER you will similarly carry letters or other written parchments between two corresponding trolls, though in both cases you will charge an additional fee of ZERO TROLL POUNDS if the path of delivery includes significant SEA ROUTE, to account for the increased maintenance of your SAILSHIP. Cheaper still, you will RELOCATE HIDDEN PARCELS between pretermined hidden drop locations for a mere ZERO TROLL YEN, and on the more expensive side you will SURVEY A DELIVERY ROUTE to better optimize later transports for ONE TROLL EURO.

At the moment, business is QUITE POOR, as the imperial alternian drone delivery networks with which you compete are ACTUALLY QUITE EFFICIENT, though at your current prices you do sometimes have customers. You believe your main COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE lies in the implicit offer of all parcels being delivered away from the prying gaze of the alternian authorities in TOTAL SECRECY. In fact, you secretly hope someone would use your COURIERSHIP for communicating and coordinating SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, but this has YET TO HAPPEN. That you know of at least, you take your duties seriously and haven't actually checked. Your decreasingly subtle hints about this in your marketing appear to fall on deaf ears. You find this DEEPLY FRUSTRATING.
When not walking the surface of planet delivering missives, you take an interest in other forms of CONCEALED COMMUNICATION, such as TROLL STEGANOGRAPHY AND CIPHERS. You prefer traditonal means of message transmission, and are deeply distrustful of modern TRANS-TROLLTELEGRAM services such as TROLLIAN, which you belive to be under constant monitoring by the imperial authorities, though are UNABLE TO PROVE this. You believe it is important to SPEAK AND WRITE WELL -- though you are not terribly good it, you think -- but if you must TYPE then your trolltag is acropolisCourier [AC] and your writing is very terse. minimal.

Your sylladex operates on the logic of a HEAP MODUS, for convenient sorting of packages ahead of delivery. Since you would PREFER TO BE A PACIFIST, you have allocated your strife specibus in the PENKIND ABSTRATA, but you quickly discovered that being a pacifist on Alternia is literally impossible and have taken to designing a variety of blade- and explosive-concealing pen designs. Package delivery is hard work, and always a race to SAVE TIME, an element of which you will turn out to be a PAGE, but you do not yet know this.

[There has been a slight uptick in business of late, however, as Imperial authorities declared illegal a TROLL INTERNET DRAWN STORY called HIVEBENT, which had concluded a number of years before it drew their attention. Though most of the demand for STORY THEMED CRAFTS has been filled in that time, what few purchases are still made have to be arranged through alternative couriers such as yourself.] 

As a traveller, you know the importance of dressing appropriately for different weathers and climates. Therefore, you always carry at least five outfits with you. [You are provisionally a Derse dreamer of the sign LIBRIES, but as a covert mail carrier you think clothing that narrows down your identity to one twelfth of the population to be a foolish endeavour.]
