AGE: 19
CHUMTAG: archaeopteryxGallopade
CLASSPECT: Seer of Breath
FETCH MODUS: iPod modus (Items can be retrieved using an ipod, each item is intracitley tagged and sorted with metadata to make finding them amongst the hoard easier. It takes a lot of time and really isnt worth it, but doing it puts wind into a sort of zen state. Almost every time a new item is added wind re-sorts them to account for changes in winds sorting methodology.)
STRIFE SPECIBUS: Yoyokind (Wind picked it because wind likes Sukeban Deka)
INTRESTS: Puppetry, Clowns, Obscure cartoons, Dolls, digital preservation, X-Men, and music (punk, grunge, and general alternative (plus the occasional classic pop like the monkees and the beach boys) (its a spectrum of stuff and ill inform as we go).
Wind suffers chronic migraines and fatigue, meaning winds constantly fucking exhausted and it sucks. As a result wind has missed out on a lot of life experiences and tends to integrate fictional characters onto windself as a sort of coping mechanism. This tends to get out of hand quickly and they go through boughs of delusion attachment.   Wind tends to spend most of winds time in bed and dreads social interaction, usually ending up going silent around others out of paralyzation. Wind can be quick to defense when challenged on certain topics, mostly trans shit though, and has a bad habit of poking the metaphorical bear. (let me know if this needs to be revised)
