Description: Your name is JASON. Your pronouns are HE/HIM. At 17 YEARS OLD, you would describe yourself as a FURRY, with your primary interest being in the PANTHERINE. Your fursona is named STARFANG PRIMEMEOW and he is SOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOL. You also have a variety of INTERESTS. You are gradually learning CYBERSECURITY and COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, and are BECOMING BETTER AT IT. You quite like playing VIDEO GAMES, mostly of the RETRO NINTENDO variety. You have also taken up SPEEDCUBING recently, but you COULD BE A LOT BETTER. You live with your MOTHER and GRANDMOTHER, who own the TIMBERLINE LODGE at MOUNT HOOD, and got an additional permit to LIVE THERE. Your FETCH MODUS creates a manifestation of a library, with the desired item being a book. You wield the PISTOLKIND ABSTRATUS, as you fucking love GUNS, and there are a lot of BEARS around these parts. You generally like saving SPACE, and you hope other people are on the same PAGE. Your Discord username is entrepeneurialFelid#2023, and if youâ€™re on your phone, you type fairly well, but on yourr computte, occasionally some letttes like o skip or be duplicated.
