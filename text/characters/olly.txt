bio: this dipshit spends all of his day locked up in his room. he runs various music pirating services for an ad-revenue profit, as well as propagating his own music,  which is usually heavily sampled. aside from his interests in composing music, he also plays the piano (although he currently only has a shitty keyboard) and occasionally dabbles in the confectionary arts. supposedly, he is much better at that than his music. he's constantly keeping himself occupied with something, whether it's being a completionist for a certain game or trying his hand at coding. personality-wise, although he is amicable with strangers he's goofy as shit with people he knows and unknowingly has a lack of social awareness most of the time. even though he can get pretty heated when arguing sometimes, he usually isn't a dick for the sake of it. he tends to gravitate towards leadership positions when in a group, and when he needs to, he'll gladly don a much more likable persona if it's to his benefit. if things aren't working out, he'll go rogue until he has enough time to figure out a more cohesive plan.
