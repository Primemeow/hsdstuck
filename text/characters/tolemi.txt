Modus - Tarot
(item is assigned one of the cards from eithe Major ot Minor Arcana based on relevance and power/importance, i.e. weapons can be stored n the "Swords" cards, a pile of 5 candies can be stored in any of the "five" cards. The Major Arcana is reserved to the itmes of great importance/Value/Power. for example, the CueBall will be stored in the Magician's card, while something like The Tumore will be stored in the Tower card. After storing the deck is shuffled, including the rotation of cards. when pulled out from the deck, if the card is reversed, the item is launched, but you can see the position before item retrieval
though 78 cards might be a bit too much, so i can reduce it to just 4 suits and 22 cards of The Major Arcana for a total of 26. or maybe ditch the suits as well... idk, this question needs balancing

Your name is TOLEMI. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for ASTRONOMY and ASTROLOGY. You practice in MYSTERIES and ARCANE, enjoying the intricaces of the OBSCURE. Though your goal is not to uncover and share this knowledge, but to dive in it, almost as if to become whole with it. You ocassioanly beguile and delude your friends in order to further your connection to the TENEBROSITY, and shape it to your DESIRES, but always help them in return as well. Across your room are scattered various ESOTERIC PARAPHERNALIA. Your RECUPERACOON silently sits in the corner, NEGLECTED and sad, hardly ever seeing any use in the past few sweeps .
Your lusus is an Owl Featherbeast. and as usual he's out hunting in the night, which leaves you all alone to your own deeds.
Your trollhandle is arcaneStargazer, and y☉u speak in a s☉mew♄at ☾☉smi☾al r♄yt♄m.
