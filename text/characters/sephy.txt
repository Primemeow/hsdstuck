bio: Sephyr is a goldblood that was born in Noternia. He has many interests, such as guns, video games and music (especially modern dubstep music). He is known for his kindness, intelligence and his weird yet funny but constant overreacting to things. Thus, his quirk is litterally both in lowercase and uppercase letters (ex. : i might have GO77EN MY2ELF IN A BIG PROBLEM). He was called many times a cultist or a priest (well, mostly priest) because of his unique outfit. To everyone it is unknown if he actually is one. His powers are very powerful, and no one can actually define how powerful are they. He was rarely defeated in any battle he fought. Also, don't give him big rocket launchers. He tends to go crazy while handling one. He is a big fan of jokes and likes making pranks with his buddies or even quadrantmates. He is a really funny guy. He is a really good moirail, a solid matesprit, and probably a good kismesis too. His lusus is Cinder, a buff monstorous-like creature with wings. As for things he does, he is productive (well, sort of) and likes helping out. He also makes some money out of his music, which sounds... fine to the very least. He also has highblood buddies, and he isn't afraid of them. He likes the clowns.
