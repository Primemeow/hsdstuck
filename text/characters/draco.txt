Your name is ???? DRAEKOV, but you go by your nickname DRACO.
Your MODUS is STICKYKIND, allowing you to store up to fourteen items at once, but you must draw them all at the same time. Your STRIFE SPECIBI are BLADEKIND and REVOLVERKIND which work HAND IN HAND in COMBAT. You go by your online handle calculatedCorrection under which you ANNOY people.

You lead a pretty normal life. HIGHER EDUCATION leaves you with HEFTY WORKLOADS reducing the amount of free time you get to spend, but when you have nothing to do, you HELP AROUND AT HOME or CAUSE DISSENSION ONLINE thanks to your unwanted presence. Truth be told, you have been raised as a POLITE, WELL-MANNERED ASSISTANT, but you are prone to being PUSHED OVER THE EDGE from time to time.
