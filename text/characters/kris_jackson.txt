Your name is KRIS JACKSON. You go by SHE/THEY. Your discord tag is dysfunctionalDumbass, and you don't use periods or capital letters to begin sentences for some reason but use a bunch of line breaks instead
You have recently read a CONTROVERSIAL WEBCOMIC, and consider yourself a ROUGE of LIFE. You have a variety of INTERESTS, some of which include, most obviously. VIDEO GAMES of a very STRANGE range. You also enjoy PUZZLES, as you like CHALLENGING your brain and seeing if you can figure things out.
You use the TETRIS MODUS, which means you must carefully choose where you place things in your sylladex, which you have trouble doing because of the latter half of your chumhandle, but you love TETRIS so you'll figure it out. 
You wield the SCISSORKIND ABSTRATUS because, quite frankly, scissors are pretty COOL and you just so happen to have a bunch lying around.
